# Pi Leibniz Rust

This is a simple program that approximates the value of π using the Leibniz formula for π. The program will print out the approximation of π after every 1,000,000,000 iterations.

## Pi Leibniz Formula

The Leibniz formula for π is as follows:

π = 4 * (1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + 1/9 - 1/11 + ...)

This formula is an alternating series that converges to π. The more iterations that are performed, the closer the approximation will be to π.


## Usage

To run the program, execute the following command:

```bash
cargo run
```
